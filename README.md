# tops-and-tracks

An audio visualizer of a thirty second preview of a song of your choice.

On the left you have a `Tops` section where you can play with a Spotify user's profile picture. One can enter any Spotify username or a Spotify username link and it will output an artistic rendition of the profile picture.

On the right, you have a `Tracks` section where you are prompted to enter a song name. You will then be shown three album/song covers in which once you hover over them you'll see the title and artists' name.

Once you select an album cover, you can click again, and a 30 second audio visualization of the song will play. You can preview the other songs by clicking `Tracks` again.
